I'm a C language learner, and this repository contains all the code I've written since I started learning C. 
I'll keep updating it regularly as long as I'm still learning C or writing C code. 
You can use this repository in a few ways: first, by browsing through the different folders, or second, by checking the commit history—or really, any other method you prefer.
I warmly welcome anyone to make use of this repository.
Don’t hesitate or feel shy—if this repository brings even a little value to you, I’ll be truly happy.
Otherwise, what’s the point of creating it? I’ve also grown thanks to the selfless sharing of those who came before me.
